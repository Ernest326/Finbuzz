# Finbuzz

Finbuzz is a simple stock market alert system which uses the Yahoo stock market API in order to detect any significant drops and alerts the user.  

At the moment support is being made for telegram bots however in the future I plan on doing an implementation for different types of bots  

## Setup:
This project uses uv as the python package manager, which can be installed via ``python -m pip install uv``  

Afterwards the following commands can be run:  
``uv sync``  
``uv run main.py``
